This folder contains the following files:


NoiseRef1.wav       
	Audio from one of the interfering noise sources

NoiseRef2.wav       
	Audio from the other interfering noise source

NoisySignal.wav     
	Audio of the speech signal in the presence of interfering noise sources subject to room reverberation and additive hum


Plot_Spectrogram.m  
	MATLAB script to plot the spectrogram

CleanSignal_Spectrogram.jpg    
	The spectrogram of the speech signal without interference (using Plot_Spectrpgram.m)




In addition to listening to the quality of the enhanced signal you can also calculate the spectrogram of the enhanced signal and compare with the clean spectrogram
